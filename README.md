## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Earth System Science group at the Center for Advanced Systems Understanding ([CASUS](https://www.casus.science/)), located in GÃ¶rlitz, Germany. I am studying animal-road interactions and movement ecology study design. My PhD was based in Thailand, working on the spatial-temporal patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions in a Thai biodiversity hotspot, with a secondary focus on bat communities. I am particularly interested in movement ecology and road ecology.

ðŸš§ Iâ€™m currently working on:<br>
- [`{movedesign}`](https://github.com/ecoisilva/movedesign), a `{Shiny}` application to assist in movement study design that leverages the `{ctmm}` R package;

ðŸ”­ Recently, I have worked on:<br>
- [`{AKDE_minireview_ms}`](https://github.com/ecoisilva/AKDE_minireview), a review and tutorial to autocorrelated home range estimation using `{R}`.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:<br>
- Anything related to animal movement analyses or the study design of tracking projects. I am also really interested in anything to do with wildlife-vehicle collisions or wildlife-road interactions. If youâ€™re looking for collaborations, assistance or advice in these areas, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d be happy to help!
