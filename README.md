## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Earth System Science group at the Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS), located in GÃ¶rlitz, Germany. I am studying animal-road interactions and movement ecology study design. My PhD was based in Thailand, working on the spatial-temporal patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions in a Thai biodiversity hotspot, with a secondary focus on bat communities. I am particularly interested in movement ecology and road ecology.

ðŸš§ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [`{movedesign}`](https://github.com/ecoisilva/movedesign), a `{Shiny}` application to assist in movement study design that leverages the `{ctmm}` R package;

ðŸ”­ I have worked on:
- [`{AKDE_minireview}`]([https://github.com/ecoisilva/movedesign](https://github.com/ecoisilva/AKDE_minireview), a review and tutorial to autocorrelated home range estimation.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Iâ€™m available to collaborate on projects related to the animal movement analyses or the study design of tracking projects. If youâ€™re looking for assistance or advice in these areas, feel free to reach outâ€” Iâ€™d be happy to help!
